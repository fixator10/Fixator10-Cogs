        "Hello user. Thank for installing my new Captcha cog!\n"
        "This cog is the super, evolved version of my old cog, Captcher, which is now officially "
        "deprecated for this cog, and oh god, this is really a big step for me!\n\n"
        "What can I say now? YeahRight! This message. You don't need to worry about them, they are "
        "just my patchnotes for this cog! I hope you don't mind me for adding them, I may use them "
        "sometime, that's cool to keep peoples updated. You'll receive a message each time the "
        "patchnotes got updated.\n\n"
        "So, what happened during the rewrite/migration? In case you was an user of Captcher, I "
        "decided to drop your data and don't reuse them, meaning that all guilds will have to "
        "reconfigure this new cog to use captcha again.\n\n"
        "Oh yeah, super thing I'm proud of, there's now 3 types of Captcha, image, wheezy and plain."
        "They're super cool, plain is using plain text, and have a little security to avoid copy and "
        "paste. There's also wheezy, an easier to read captcha, with less drawing. This new and "
        "amazing functionallity goes back to calebj, creator of the Captcha cog for Red V2, which "
        "had the same thing, I got inspired of it and copied some code. Thank you!\n\n"
        "AH yes, cog's stability, it is now WAY more stable than before, and way more efficient and "
        "easier to maintain. \N{UPSIDE-DOWN FACE}\n\n"
        "I really hope you'll enjoy this cog. Again, if you wish to support me, there's my Paypal "
